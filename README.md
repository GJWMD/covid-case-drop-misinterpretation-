# covid-case-drop-misinterpretation-
You are not interpreting the graph of case says with covid appropriately. The reason your report that the case of numbers are not going down it’s because the increase in testing has been exponential. That is why the numbers don’t go down. This does not reflect the prevalence of disease, only testing. If you look at Sunday and Monday the numbers go down to levels and seen in March. What is the reason? Could it be that the testing labs are closed on weekendsAnd not reporting till Monday night? Does it mean that the testing center is closed on Sundays in there for the numbers for Sunday and Monday go down, could it be that people don’t go get tested since Sunday as a family and possible religious day? If you draw a line of the findings on Sunday and Monday morning you will notice a marked decrease in that represents the true number of cases, they are going down significantly. Epidemiologist in your group needs to reviewThese numbers since I think we are clearly being misguided, there is a false sense that the numbers are the same or increasing when the reality is that they are going down. Otherwise I will only go out on Sunday and Monday since the numbers are down and that would be inapropriate interpretation.
